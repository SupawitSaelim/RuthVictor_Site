                        <h2>What is Log Management?</h2>
                        <p>Organizations produce vast amounts of log data and events from applications, networks,
                            systems, and users. Managing this data requires a systematic process to oversee and monitor
                            disparate log files. Log management involves the continuous process of centrally collecting,
                            parsing, storing, analyzing, and disposing of data to provide actionable insights, which
                            support troubleshooting, performance enhancement, and security monitoring.</p>
                        <h2>What is a log file?</h2>
                        <p>Log files are computer-generated data files that serve as a primary data source for
                            information related to the activities, operations, and usage patterns of applications,
                            servers, operating systems, and other devices. Logs are crucial for identifying and
                            analyzing situations when applications, systems, and networks encounter operational
                            bottlenecks or performance issues. They provide a detailed record of every action, offering
                            insights that help identify the root cause of problems or anomalies.

                            Log file management involves aggregating data from multiple log sources. The following are
                            the most common log types</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Application Logs</b> : These logs are generated when an event occurs within an
                                application. Code developers use application logs to understand and measure how
                                applications behave during the development cycle and prior to release.</li>
                            <li><b>System Logs</b> : These logs record events generated within the operating system,
                                such as
                                driver errors during startup, sign-in and sign-out events, and other system activities.
                            </li>
                            <li><b>Security Logs</b> : These logs provide a detailed record of security events that
                                occur
                                on a computer. They collect various types of events, such as unsuccessful login
                                attempts, failed authentication requests, password changes, or file deletions.
                                Administrators can usually configure which events they want to record and track in the
                                security log.</li><br><br>
                            <h2>How to collect and organize logs</h2>
                            <p>Organizations should collect, store, and organize data in a unified manner to make
                                sifting through massive log data easy and quick. Implementing an out-of-the-box log
                                management solution with an intuitive interface and smart capabilities helps businesses
                                get a complete overview of the IT environment and ensure rapid issue identification and
                                troubleshooting. The key steps in the log management process are listed below</p>

                                    <h3>Centralized Log Aggregation and Standardization</h3>
                                    <p>Aggregating logs from multiple sources in one place is imperative. Leveraging
                                        automated log management systems helps overcome the challenges of manual log
                                        collection and aggregation, reducing the probability of errors and improving the
                                        speed of operations. It also facilitates remote log management, simplifies the
                                        overall process, and minimizes the cost and effort of managing massive log
                                        volumes. Since logs from multiple sources may come in different formats, log
                                        management solutions ensure data parsing to transform logs into a standard
                                        format for easy analysis.</p>
                                    <h3>Event Correlation</h3>
                                    <p>Intelligent log management systems improve log monitoring by leveraging machine
                                        learning or rules-based algorithms to correlate events across systems. Drawing
                                        connections between related events helps in capturing a bigger picture and
                                        deriving actionable insights for better troubleshooting.</p>

                                    <h3>Log Search and Analysis</h3>
                                    <p>With smart log management solutions, enterprises can easily filter log data via
                                        intuitive search capability. An in-built powerful search engine helps refine log
                                        data and quickly finds log entries, saving time and effort. Businesses can also
                                        employ intelligent log analysis tools to identify the root cause before an issue
                                        escalates.</p>
                                    <h3>Log Reporting and Visualization</h3>

                            <!-- SIEM -->
                            <h2>What is security information and event management (SIEM)?</h2>
                            <p>Security information and event management (SIEM) is a security solution that helps
                                organizations recognize and address potential security threats and vulnerabilities
                                before they can disrupt business operations. SIEM systems enable enterprise security
                                teams to detect user behavior anomalies and utilize artificial intelligence (AI) to
                                automate many of the manual processes associated with threat detection and incident
                                response.</p>
                            <p>The original SIEM platforms began as log management tools, combining security information
                                management (SIM) and security event management (SEM) functions. These platforms enabled
                                real-time monitoring and analysis of security-related events and facilitated tracking
                                and logging of security data for compliance or auditing purposes. Gartner coined the
                                term SIEM for the combination of SIM and SEM technologies in 2005.

                                Over the years, SIEM software has evolved to incorporate user and entity behavior
                                analytics (UEBA), advanced security analytics, AI, and machine learning capabilities for
                                identifying anomalous behaviors and indicators of advanced threats. Today, SIEM has
                                become a staple in modern security operation centers (SOCs) for security monitoring and
                                compliance management use cases.</p>
                            <h2>How does SIEM work?</h2>
                            <p>At the most basic level, all SIEM solutions perform data aggregation, consolidation, and
                                sorting functions to identify threats and adhere to data compliance requirements. While
                                some solutions vary in capability, most offer the same core set of functions:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><b>
                                        <h3>Log management</h3>
                                    </b>SIEM ingests event data from a wide range of sources across
                                    an organization’s entire IT infrastructure, including on-premises and cloud
                                    environments.

                                    Event log data from users, endpoints, applications, data sources, cloud workloads,
                                    and networks, as well as from security hardware and software like firewalls or
                                    antivirus programs, is collected, correlated, and analyzed in real time.

                                    Some SIEM solutions also integrate with third-party threat intelligence feeds to
                                    correlate internal security data against known threat signatures and profiles.
                                    Integration with real-time threat feeds enables teams to block or detect new types
                                    of attack signatures.</li><br>

                                        <h3>Event correlation and analytics</h3>
                                    </b>Event correlation is a crucial component of any SIEM solution. Using advanced
                                    analytics to identify and understand complex data patterns, event correlation
                                    provides insights to quickly locate and mitigate potential threats to business
                                    security.

                                    SIEM solutions significantly improve mean time to detect (MTTD) and mean time to
                                    respond (MTTR) for IT security teams by automating the manual workflows associated
                                    with the in-depth analysis of security events.</li><br>

                                        <h3>Incident monitoring and security alerts</h3>
                                    </b>SIEM consolidates its analysis into a single, central dashboard where security
                                    teams monitor activity, triage alerts, identify threats, and initiate response or
                                    remediation.

                                    Most SIEM dashboards also include real-time data visualizations that help security
                                    analysts spot spikes or trends in suspicious activity. Using customizable,
                                    predefined correlation rules, administrators can be alerted immediately and take
                                    appropriate actions to mitigate threats before they materialize into more
                                    significant security issues.</li><br><br>

                                <!-- SOAR -->
                                <h2>What Is SOAR?</h2>
                                <p>Security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) technology streamline and
                                    automate security operations by coordinating tasks across people and tools within a
                                    unified platform. This enables organizations to rapidly respond to cybersecurity
                                    threats while also gaining insights to prevent future incidents, ultimately
                                    enhancing their overall security posture.</p>
                                <p>A comprehensive SOAR product, as defined by Gartner, operates under three primary
                                    software capabilities: threat and vulnerability management, security incident
                                    response, and security operations automation.

                                    Threat and vulnerability management (orchestration) encompass technologies that
                                    address cyberthreats, while security operations automation (automation) pertains to
                                    technologies enabling automation and orchestration within operations.</p>
                                <img src="images/log_4.png" width="50%" style="margin-left: 15em;" alt="">
                                <p>SOAR platforms ingest alert data, which then initiates playbooks automating response
                                    workflows or tasks. Leveraging a blend of human expertise and machine learning,
                                    organizations can analyze this varied data to understand and prioritize automated
                                    incident response actions for future threats, thereby enhancing cybersecurity
                                    practices and refining security operations.</p><br>
                                <h2>SOAR vs. SIEM</h2>
                                <p>Many consider SOAR and SIEM as akin products because both identify security issues
                                    and gather data about the nature of the problem. They also handle notifications that
                                    security personnel can use to address concerns. However, significant differences
                                    exist between them.</p>
                                <p>SOAR, like SIEM, gathers data and notifies security teams via a centralized platform.
                                    However, while SIEM solely delivers alerts to security analysts, SOAR integrates
                                    automation and response into the investigation process through automated playbooks
                                    or workflows and artificial intelligence (AI) for pattern behavior learning. This
                                    capability enables SOAR to anticipate similar threats before they occur.
                                    Additionally, SOAR platforms like Cortex XSOAR often ingest alerts from sources not
                                    covered by SIEMs, such as vulnerability scan findings, cloud security alerts, and
                                    IoT device alerts. This integration facilitates alert deduplication, a common use
                                    case for SOAR and SIEM integration, which reduces the time required for manual alert
                                    handling. Consequently, IT security personnel can more efficiently detect and
                                    address threats.</p><br><br>
