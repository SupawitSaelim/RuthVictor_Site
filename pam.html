                <h2>What is Privileged Access Management?</h2>
                <p>Privileged Access Management (PAM) encompasses cybersecurity strategies and technologies
                    designed to control elevated ("privileged") access and permissions for identities, users,
                    accounts, processes, and systems within an IT environment. By appropriately tailoring
                    privileged access controls, PAM aids organizations in reducing their attack surface, thereby
                    mitigating the impact of external attacks and insider threats.</p>
                <p>Among the many strategies within privilege management, a core objective is the implementation
                    of least privilege, which involves limiting access rights and permissions for users,
                    accounts, applications, systems, devices (including IoT), and computing processes to the
                    minimum necessary for authorized activities.

                    Referred to alternatively as privileged account management, privileged identity management
                    (PIM), or simply privilege management, Privileged Access Management (PAM) is regarded by
                    analysts and technologists as a crucial security initiative. It serves to mitigate cyber
                    risk, fulfill compliance requirements, and yield substantial returns on security
                    investments.</p>
                <p>Privilege management operates within the broader framework of identity and access management
                    (IAM) and identity security. Together, PAM and IAM contribute to delivering fine-grained
                    control, visibility, and auditability over all credentials, privileges, and access.<br>

                    While IAM controls ensure the authentication of identities, guaranteeing that the right user
                    has the right access at the right time, PAM adds an additional layer of granular visibility,
                    control, and auditing over privileged identities and session activities. PAM is a core
                    component of identity security, which analysts and IT leaders view as crucial for
                    safeguarding enterprise assets and users, particularly in a perimeterless,
                    work-from-anywhere (WFA) environment. The identity infrastructure itself, including IAM and
                    IGA toolsets, is increasingly targeted by cyber threats, highlighting the necessity for
                    robust PAM controls to protect it comprehensively.</p>

                <h2 style="color: black;">What Are Privileges and How Are They Created?</h2>
                <p>
                    In information technology (IT), privilege refers to the authority granted to a specific
                    account or process within a computing system or network. This authorization enables the
                    account or process to override or bypass certain security restrictions, allowing actions
                    like shutting down systems, loading device drivers, configuring networks or systems,
                    provisioning and configuring accounts and cloud instances, and more.
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    In his book "Privileged Attack Vectors," industry thought leader Morey Haber provides a
                    fundamental definition: "privilege is a special right or advantage. It entails an elevation
                    above the normal and is not merely a setting or permission granted to the masses."
                </blockquote>
                <p>Privileges play a crucial role in operations by granting elevated rights to users,
                    applications, and system processes, allowing them access to specific resources and
                    facilitating work-related tasks. However, the potential for misuse or exploitation of
                    privilege, whether by insiders or external attackers, poses a significant security challenge
                    for organizations.

                    Operating systems, file systems, applications, databases, hypervisors, cloud management
                    platforms, and other components incorporate privileges for various user accounts and
                    processes. Additionally, certain privileged users, such as system or network administrators,
                    have the ability to assign privileges.

                    Depending on the system, privilege assignment, or delegation, to individuals may be based on
                    role-based attributes, such as business unit (e.g., marketing, HR, or IT), as well as
                    various other parameters like seniority, time of day, or special circumstances.

            <div class="container">
                <h2>What are Privileged Accounts?</h2>
                <p>A privileged account is defined as any account that offers access and privileges surpassing
                    those of non-privileged accounts. Concurrently, a privileged user is someone currently
                    utilizing privileged access, typically through a privileged account. Due to their heightened
                    capabilities and access, privileged users and accounts present significantly greater risks
                    compared to non-privileged counterparts.

                    Superuser accounts, a special category of privileged accounts, are primarily utilized for
                    administrative purposes by specialized IT personnel. These accounts grant virtually
                    unrestricted power to execute commands and implement system modifications. Commonly referred
                    to as "Root" in Unix/Linux and "Administrator" in Windows systems, superuser accounts enjoy
                    broad access to files, directories, and resources with full read, write, and execute
                    permissions. They possess the authority to enact systemic changes across a network,
                    including file creation or installation, modification of files and settings, and user and
                    data deletion. Moreover, superusers hold the capability to grant and revoke permissions for
                    other users.

                    If misused, whether inadvertently (e.g., accidental deletion of a critical file or erroneous
                    command input) or maliciously, these highly privileged accounts can precipitate catastrophic
                    damage throughout a system, or even across the entire enterprise.</p>
                <p>In Windows systems, each computer typically includes at least one administrator account. The
                    Administrator account permits users to carry out activities like software installation and
                    adjustments to local configurations and settings.

                    macOS, conversely, adopts a Unix-like structure but is seldom deployed as a server compared
                    to Unix and Linux. Users on Mac endpoints may typically operate with root access by default.
                    However, adhering to macOS security best practices, it is recommended to establish and
                    utilize a non-privileged account for routine computing tasks, thereby reducing the potential
                    for and impact of privileged threats.<br>

                    In a least privilege environment, the majority of users primarily operate with
                    non-privileged accounts 90-100% of the time. These non-privileged accounts, often referred
                    to as least privileged accounts (LUA), generally fall into two categories</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Standard user accounts: These accounts possess a restricted set of privileges, typically
                        allowing activities such as internet browsing, accessing specific applications (e.g., MS
                        Office), and limited resource access, often dictated by role-based access policies.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Guest user accounts: These accounts have even fewer privileges than standard user
                        accounts, usually limited to basic application usage and internet browsing.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </div>

        <div class="wrapper style2 special fade-up">
            <div class="container">
                <h2>What are Privileged Credentials?</h2>
                <p>Privileged credentials, also known as privileged passwords, constitute a subset of credentials
                    that confer elevated access and permissions across various accounts, applications, and systems.
                    These credentials can be associated with human users, applications, service accounts, and more.
                    Among these, SSH keys represent a type of privileged credential widely used in enterprises to
                    access servers and establish connections to highly sensitive assets.

                    In some instances, particularly within DevOps environments, privileged credentials may be
                    referred to as "secrets."</p>
                <p>Privileged account passwords are often dubbed as "the keys to the IT kingdom" due to their
                    capability, especially in the case of superuser passwords, to grant authenticated users nearly
                    unrestricted privileged access rights across an organization's most critical systems and data.
                    Given the significant power embedded within these privileges, they are susceptible to abuse by
                    insiders and are highly sought after by hackers. According to Forrester Research, approximately
                    80% of security breaches involve the compromise of privileged credentials.</p>

                <h2>Types of Privileged Accounts</h2>
                <p>As a best practice, most non-IT users should only have access to standard user accounts.
                    However, some IT employees may have multiple accounts. They may log in as standard users for
                    routine tasks and switch to superuser accounts for administrative activities. Since
                    administrative accounts carry more privileges and consequently pose a greater risk if
                    misused or abused, it's recommended in Privileged Access Management (PAM) to use these
                    accounts only when absolutely necessary and for the shortest duration possible.</p>
                <p><b>Examples of privileged accounts typically in an organization</b></p>
                <p>
                    <li><b>Local administrative accounts:</b> Non-personal accounts providing administrative
                        access to the local host or instance only.</li>
                    <li><b>Domain administrative accounts:</b> Granting privileged administrative access across
                        all workstations and servers within the domain.</li>
                    <li><b>Break glass (also called emergency or firecall) accounts:</b> Emergency provision of
                        administrative access to unprivileged users for secure systems.</li>
                    <li><b>Service account:</b> Accounts, whether local or domain-based, endowed with
                        privileges, utilized by an application or service to interact with the operating system.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Active Directory or domain service accounts:</b> Enable password changes to accounts,
                        etc.</li>
                    <li><b>Application accounts:</b> Utilized by applications for tasks such as accessing
                        databases, executing batch jobs or scripts, or facilitating access to other
                        applications.</li>
                </p>
                <p>In recent times, privileged accounts are often linked to a machine identity rather than a
                    human one. The rise of machine accounts, as seen in Robotic Process Automation (RPA) and
                    other automated workflows, introduces considerable security complexity to IT environments.
                    This underscores the critical role of Privileged Access Management (PAM) systems in managing
                    these accounts effectively.</p>

                            accounts, which may number in the millions, present dangerous backdoors for attackers,
                            including former employees who have left the company but still retain access. Additionally,
                            many cloud identities and accounts are dynamic and ephemeral, yet carry extensive
                            privileges. This increasingly blurs the distinction between unprivileged and privileged
                            identities. A vague understanding of who possesses what access and how they utilize it
                            leaves organizations vulnerable to undetected threats and attack paths.</p>

                    <li><b style="color: black;">Over-provisioning of privileges.</b>
                        <p>If privileged access controls are overly restrictive, they can disrupt user workflows,
                            causing frustration and hindering productivity. Since end users rarely complain about having
                            too many privileges, IT admins traditionally grant broad sets of privileges. Additionally,
                            an employee’s role often evolves, leading to the accumulation of new responsibilities and
                            corresponding privileges, while still retaining privileges they no longer need.<br><br>

                            This excess of privileges contributes to a bloated attack surface. Routine computing for
                            employees on personal PCs might include internet browsing, streaming video, using MS Office
                            and other basic applications, including SaaS tools (e.g., Salesforce.com, Google Docs,
                            Slack). In the case of Windows PCs, users often log in with administrative account
                            privileges, which are far broader than necessary. These excessive privileges significantly
                            increase the risk of malware or hackers stealing passwords or installing malicious code via
                            web surfing or email attachments. The malware or hacker could then exploit the full set of
                            privileges of the account, accessing data on the infected computer and potentially launching
                            attacks against other networked computers or servers.</p>

                            convenience, allowing workloads and duties to be seamlessly shared. However, when multiple
                            people use the same account password, it becomes impossible to attribute actions performed
                            with that account to a single individual. This practice creates significant security,
                            auditability, and compliance issues.</p>

                            devices, and IoT devices may be shipped or deployed with embedded, default credentials that
                            are easily guessable and pose substantial risks. Additionally, employees often hardcode
                            secrets in plain text—such as within a script, code, or file—making them easily accessible
                            when needed.</p>

                        <p>Privilege security controls are often immature. Privileged accounts and credentials may be
                            managed differently across various organizational silos, resulting in inconsistent
                            enforcement of best practices. Human privilege management processes cannot scale in most IT
                            environments, where thousands—or even millions—of privileged accounts, credentials, and
                            assets can exist. With so many systems and accounts to manage, humans invariably take
                            shortcuts, such as re-using credentials across multiple accounts and assets. Consequently,
                            one compromised account can jeopardize the security of other accounts sharing the same
                            credentials.</p>

                    Benefits of Privileged Access Management
                </h2>
                <p>The more privileges and access a user, account, or process accumulates, the higher the risk of abuse,
                    exploitation, or error. Implementing privilege management not only reduces the likelihood of a
                    security breach occurring but also helps contain the impact of a breach should one occur.
                    Implementing Privileged Access Management (PAM) best practices, such as removing admin rights,
                    enforcing least privilege, and eliminating default or embedded credentials, is a crucial aspect of
                    hardening enterprise IT systems.

                    One key distinction between PAM and other security technologies is that PAM can disrupt multiple
                    points of the cyberattack chain, offering protection against both external attacks and attacks that
                    penetrate networks and systems.</p>
